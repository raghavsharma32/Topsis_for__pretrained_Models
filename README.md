# 🏆 TOPSIS for Pre-trained Models

## 🌟 Overview
The `topsis_pre_trained_models` project applies the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method to evaluate and select the best pre-trained models for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It supports evaluation across tasks such as:
- Text Summarization
- Text Generation
- Text Classification
- Text Conversational
- Text Sentence Similarity

## 🎯 Purpose
In the rapidly evolving field of NLP, choosing the most effective pre-trained model is challenging due to the wide variety of models and performance metrics. This project uses the TOPSIS method to compare these models, providing a way for researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions based on performance metrics.

## 🛠️ Supported Tasks
| Task                     | Description                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Text Summarization**   | Evaluates models that condense lengthy texts into concise summaries while preserving key information.       |
| **Text Generation**      | Assesses models capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on prompts.             |
| **Text Classification**  | Compares models that categorize text into predefined classes or labels.                                     |
| **Text Conversational**  | Evaluates models designed to understand and generate human-like responses in a conversation.                |
| **Text Sentence Similarity** | Compares models that assess how similar two sentences are based on their meanings.                     |
